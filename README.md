# Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

#### Developers     	
	Hope Fetrow and Sumit Barua

#### Purpose	    		

	Final Project for CS 5820 - Artificial Intelligence

#### Objective		
	
	To learn about the functionality of the OCR process and demonstrate the practical 	
	functionality of using artificial intelligence to extract text from images. 

#### Description		

	The OCR or Optical Character Recognition is a process by which we can extract the written or printed texts in an image to actual text or string using A.I. document parsing method. This project displays the basic functionality of the OCR process, where a user can extract the text from an image and download as a .txt file or extract the check info printed at the bottom of a bank check, a key action in bank check processing. This presents the usefulness and efficiency of OCR. 
		
#### Features

    1. An interface for general text extraction and .txt/.doc conversion
    2. An automated form filling interface from Driving License/I.D.
    3. An interface for check information retrieval.
   
#### Installation 
	For virtualenv to install all files in the requirements.txt file.

	cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located
	activate your virtualenv
	run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell
	
	cd into , the directory with manage.py 
	run: python manage.py runserver
