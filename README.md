Purpose	    :	Final Project for CS 5820 or Artificial Intelligence

Objective	:	To inform the functionality of OCR process and demonstrate the practical 	
			    functionality using self-made images. 

Description	:	The OCR or Optical Character Recognition is a process by which we can 
			    extract the written or printed texts in an image to actual text or string using 
                A.I. document parsing method. For our class project, we will present the    basic functionality of OCR process and implement a practical demonstration or interface of OCR technology using modern   web development techniques. The potential features of our implementation include:
                    1.	An interface for general text extraction and .txt/.doc conversion
                    2.	An automated form filling interface from Driving License/I.D.
                    3.	An interface for basic automated form filling process.
                    4.	Other potential features will be determined during the developing
                        process and upon the approval of course instructor Dr. Hong.
