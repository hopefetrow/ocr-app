# Optical Character Recognition (OCR)


<h2> Purpose </h2>

Final Project for CS 5820 - Artificial Intelligence

<h2> Objective	</h2>
	
To learn about an AI process and demonstrate its practical functionality. 

<h2> Description </h2>

This web app presents the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process by using Tesseract, OpenCV, Python, and computer vision techniques to extract text from an image uploaded by the user. The web app has two OCR implementations.

A user can extract text from any standard image and download the extracted text as a .txt file or they can extract the numbers and symbols (to be represented by an assigned ASCII character) printed at the bottom of a bank check from its image.
		
<h2> Features </h2>
<ul>
 <li> Interface for general text extraction and .txt conversion</li>
 <li> An interface for check information retrieval.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Technologies used </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Django</li>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>CSS</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>Tesseract</li>
	<li>OpenCV</li>
	<li>imutils</li>
	<li>sci-kit image</li>
	<li>NumPy</li>
</ul>

<h2> Installation </h2>
1. Create a project directory using: "mkdir your_directory_name" <br>
2. Either unzip the ‘OCRWebApp’ folder or clone it from GitHub using: "git clone https://github.com/hopefetrow/OCRWebApp.git" <br>
3. Install virtual environment in the same directory using: "python -m venv env" <br>
4. Activate the virtual environment using: "source env/bin/activate <br>
5. Change working directory to ‘teamocr’ using: "cd teamocr" <br>
6. Install the dependencies using: "pip install -r requirements.txt" <br>
7. Run the program using: "python manage.py runserver" <br>
