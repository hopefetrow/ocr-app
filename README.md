# Optical Character Recognition (OCR)


<h2> Purpose </h2>

Final Project for CS 5820 - Artificial Intelligence

<h2> Objective	</h2>
	
To learn about the functionality of the OCR process and demonstrate the practical functionality of using artificial intelligence to extract text from images. 

<h2> Description </h2>

The OCR or Optical Character Recognition is a process by which we can extract the written or printed texts in an image to actual text or string using A.I. document parsing method. This project displays the basic functionality of the OCR process, where a user can extract the text from an image and download as a .txt file or extract the check info printed at the bottom of a bank check, a key action in bank check processing. This presents the usefulness and efficiency of OCR. 
		
<h2> Features </h2>
<ul>
 <li> Interface for general text extraction and .txt/.doc conversion</li>
 <li> An automated form filling interface from Driving License/I.D.</li>
 <li> An interface for check information retrieval.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Installation </h2>

For virtualenv to install all files in the requirements.txt file:
	<ul>
	<li>cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located</li>
	<li>activate your virtualenv</li>
	<li>run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell</li>
	</ul>

To start server and open web app:
	<ul>
	<li>cd into the directory with manage.py </li>
	<li>run: python manage.py runserver </li>
	<li>open link that appears in terminal </li>
	</ul>
